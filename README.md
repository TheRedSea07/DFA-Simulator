# DFA-Simulator
An application that can create a DFA and run simulations on it.
## Goals
- Re-consolidate knowledge about Determinisic Finite Automata (DFA) learnt in Theory of Computation
- Brush up on Java skills, including the use of graphical user interface and project management
- Try a small project, just for fun!
## Features
- [ ] Create a DFA
- [ ] Show the DFA graphically as a state machine
- [ ] Run simulations on DFA
- [ ] Save the DFA as an encoding of it
- [ ] Read the DFA from the encoding of it
## Secondary Features
These features are yet to be implemented
- Create a regular expression from a DFA
- Extend to NFA or $\epsilon$-NFA
